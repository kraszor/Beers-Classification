# Analysis of the beer data and building models for quality predictions

## The purpose of the project

The purpose of the project is to analyze the dataset about beers. Firstly, getting some important statistics, finding dependencies within data and vizualizing the most important of them. Subsequently, having this knowledge, building machine learning models with different algorithms for predicting beers' quality and compare them.
